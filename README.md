# nofi2

The second revision of Nofi.

## Usage
### Basics
To run this tool, go to `build/linux/release` and download `bundle`. Run the executable `nofi2`.
### Configuration
Running this excecutable with `-h` provides a list of arguments this tool accepts. The first few relate to the rendering process, and all others assist with how the spells are evaluated. All paths should be relative to the executable.

# Credits
NathanSnail for the [Lua script](
https://github.com/NathanSnail/wand_eval_tree.git) to evaluate the spells.
